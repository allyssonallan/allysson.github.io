				<p> Hi, I am Allysson Allan de Farias. <a href="https://forebears.io/surnames/farias">The surname has a
						portuguese origin.</a></p>
				<p> I have a fluid career path from Humanities to Biological Sciences, I am biologist with a master's
					degree in archaeology and doctorate in genetics. Postdoctoral researcher at the Università degli Studi di Padova. </p>

						<h2>Who I am</h2>
						<p>I was born in Brazil, where I took my undergraduate degree in biology at the State University
							of
							Paraiba (2006–2010) with master’s in archaeology at the Federal University of Pernambuco
							(2011–2013), and a doctoral degree in genetics at the University of Sao Paulo (2014–2018).
							Currently, I am working close to population medical genetics, collaborating as Senior
							Bioinformatician at the State University of Paraiba since 2014, who handle genomic data to
							teach programming languages, and investigate recessive autosomal diseases and the
							demographic
							history of admixed populations. Also, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Università degli Studi di Padova
							investigating polygenic risk scores in admixed populations.

						<h2>Which skills I have</h2>
						<p>As expected for a good researcher, I am resilient. One part of my skills is based on the search
							for funding agencies, collaborating in many research groups from diverse
							institutions in Brazil to compete in national and international grants. Another
							part is inside the scientific career, what enabled me to handle the huge amount of data from
							biobanks and population genetic databases (<a href="#two">What I do</a>); each research
							question raised from different groups upgraded my programming skills, I am frequently
							investigating how to
							interpret the genomic data from Brazilian tri-hybrid population.</p>

						<h2>What I am looking for</h2>
						<p>My desire is to unpick how humans have moved and evolved, uncovering some diseases during these
							processes of change. I am interested in key events in human evolution and prehistory. Also,
							I would like to draw a picture of the human population diversity in the past, to see how
							they relate to people living in recently admixed populations. In sum, I am passionate about
							big questions from human evolution to precision medicine.</p>

				<h2>What I do</h2>
				<p>I began my career in Bioinformatics during my undergraduate classes in production engineering
					at Federal University of Campina Grande (2006) while I was studying biology in parallel. My
					first language was Fortran much oriented to mathematics. Also, during the engineering
					course, I practiced C with the same orientation. Then occurred the interruption of the
					engineering path to exclusively follow the Biology course at the State University of Paraiba,
					my alma mater. The master’s in archaeology allowed me to begin practicing R language
					and analyzing spectroscopy data from pre-historical bones from 2011 to 2013. I returned
					to practice R during the doctorate using microarray data; meanwhile, I was learning Python
					to handle local ancestry pipelines and data filtering. Several programs to manage vcf and
					plink files were run with merged data from multiple sources to answer questions related to
					population genetics. The collaborations during the doctorate allowed me to use the
					server of Human Genome and Stem-Cell Research Center at the University of Sao Paulo. I
					am collaborating with a research group from the State University of Paraiba as Senior
					Bioinformatician. Several questions about GWAS, demographic history, endogamy and
					personalized medicine have been investigated with genetic data from semi-isolated and poor
					communities from Northeast Brazilian backlands. Since the beginning of coronavirus pandemic,
					I have a postdoctoral position 
					in human population genetics at the Università degli Studi di Padova looking for the effects of 
					ancestry in polygenic risk scores.  </p>
